A project I did for my Computer Science class! 
The author would be Me! Walter Alvarado
A program to help a Solar Sales Person find the best route for his trip.
* Mainly the problem I'm solving for this case is what is the best and shortest route for the salesperson 

* The solution to implementing in this case would be more like a fast and aggressive approach for this code. An approach like permutation which can be applied here. The reason being is there can be multiple routes that can be found in this solution, an algorithm. Take a Rubic cube for example, there can be different ways the cube can be solved but by using permutation mathematics it uses a linear order or sequence of set items that can arranged. The cube can have different sequences and orders to solve the cube. The same can be applied to this case, different sets of orders or “routes” in this case to find the best and most efficient route for the salesperson. Different combinations that can be used in order to find the best route. This Brute force approach is used to find all the combinations and break down the best one.
